This is the documentation for the Astronomy site.

This is an example of a doc site built using [Markdown and MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/) of Astro.

<Callout icon="⚠️" type="warning">

This site is a work in progress. If you see dummy text on a page, it means I'm still working on it. You can follow updates on Twitter [@miickasmt](https://twitter.com/miickasmt).

<Callout icon="💡" type="info">

I will gradually update the documentation of the starter template, relying on [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as references.
